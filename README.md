# Translator

In this repo we design a language translator using transformers.

1. Create an environment: `python -m venv venv`
2. Activate the environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (to deactivate just run `deactivate`)
3. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Train a model: `python -m train`
5. Load/save trained model:
   1. Save the trained model by setting `save_model` to True.
   2. Set the model filename and path in the config too.
   3. Load the model by setting `load_model` to True.
6.
